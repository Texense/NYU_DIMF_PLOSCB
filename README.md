This repository contains the source code accompanying the
paper "A data-informed mean-field approach to mapping of
cortical parameter landscapes," to appear in PLoS
Computational Biology.  See https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12286
for a preprint.

We are currently working to organize and document the code.
Eventually, this file will contain instructions on how to

- reproduce the figures in our paper

- implement the MF+v method for your own project using this
  code

Meanwhile, if you have any questions, please contact one of
us.
